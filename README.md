## k-means-ml-stu-admission

**Business Problem:** 1. A student wishes to be admitted to a top business school programme. However, due to a slightly lower score than the cut-off, they were unable to participate. So, for his score, which other college would provide a comparable quality of programme and placement options for the student?

The dean of a low-ranking college wishes to learn the name of a reference business school in order to raise his school's ranking.

We use k-means clustering machine learning algorithm to get the groups of clusters or similarities of universities so that the student can easily choose a different college of the same quality if he misses the one he wanted to join.
